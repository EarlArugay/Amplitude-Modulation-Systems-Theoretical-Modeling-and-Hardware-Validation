# Amplitude-Modulation-Systems-Theoretical-Modeling-and-Hardware-Validation
This project demonstrates a complete engineering workflow for Amplitude Modulation (AM). It bridges the gap between theoretical communication systems and practical hardware implementation. By utilizing a Telecoms Trainer and a Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO), the experiment validates mathematical models through real-time signal acquisition and analysis.
